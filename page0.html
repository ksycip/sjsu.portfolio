Artist Statement
  </h1>
<div class="statement">
<h3>
  One continuous source of inspiration in all of my work is my faith in Jesus Christ. As a student studying Digital Media Art I attempt to find inspiration from artists studied in class, from peers,  professors, and so on. But the one inspiration that I am always drawn back to is my faith.

  I believe that there is no greater weapon on this earth than the power of faith. Throughout every project, analysis, assignment, and exercise related to art there has been one grounding aspect in my life that has kept me solid in my passion for art, my faith. I fully intend to stretch this faithful fire within me across multiple disciplines and practices within my past, present, and future artworks.
</h3>
<h3>
  As my artistic skills continue to broaden and shift across platforms and disciplines, the connection between sculpture and art has been one I long to pursue. The utilization of the physical with the virtual is a relationship I wish to expand upon within my work. In MATTER OVER MIND, and PenCilate I dipped in to what could be considered our future “virtual” reality. There is a bond between these two mediums that is advancing everyday. I intend to be a part of it as I begin to enter the industry of tech and art. Rejecting the tradition of having only one medium as a preference, I aim to expand my skills across both fine and digital art.

  My main objective in my artwork is to display the power of faith, by creating a physical representation of the relationship between the physical and the non-physical, or in other words, the digital.
